# OpenMRS System Performance and Utilization Module
 OpenMRS module "System Performance and Utilization Module" to supply additional information on system performance and utilization in order to monitor reliability and impact of the electronic medical record system installation.  This module monitors OpenMRS and transfers specific system indicators, possibly using the Performance and Utilization Monitoring Program framework developed for an OpenMRS network implementation in Kenya.  The indicators could include system indicators (CPU load, etc) and application level indicators (# of opened charts, etc), as well as, the further development of the visualization of these indicators (drill-down to view details within those statistics - which users logged in, which charts were opened, etc).
